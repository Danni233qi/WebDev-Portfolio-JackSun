        <h2>Design Thinking Process</h2>
        <p>I followed these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Empathize: Thought about what visitors want to see.</li>
            <li>Define: Decided to show hobbies and future goals.</li>
            <li>Prototype: I make simple pages with HTML and CSS. I use easy colors and big headings. The pages look clean.</li>
            <li>Test: Asked friends for feedback on layout, when I finished, I got a sense of achievement and satisfaction.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>UN Global Goal: Quality Education (Goal 4)</h2>
        <p>Some kids can't go to school or get good lessons. Technology can help. For example, online classes can bring learning to far places. I hope all kids can go to school and learn happily.</p>
